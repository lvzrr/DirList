# Directory List
I got tired of the default dir command in windows
## Usage
Just add the .exe folder to your path and type `ls`, feel free to change the source code and then rebuilding with: 
```bash
go build ls.go
```
It uses unicode symbols for the icons so it should be compatible with different machines and OS

Note: the screenshot uses the theme Solarized-osaka, so it might look a bit different for you
